		<h3>Answers</h3>

    			<li>The site name was Smashing Magazine, and the url containing the article is <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/</a></li>
    			<li>Progressive Enhancements are as the name implies. Per the article I found, they're improvements that happen over time, starting with a basic, solid foundation and getting more complex with time to allow users to properly interact with the projects.</li>
    			<li>According to the article, Progressive Enhancements are necessary as they provide a good base for projects. It then allows more complicated enhancements to be added without damaging the base you already have.</li>
    			<li>The W3C Validation Service noted multiple validation errors on the homepage.</li>
    			<li>The second page also had many validation errors according to the W3C Validation Service.</li> 
    			<li>The first page had a total of 57 listed errors/warnings. The second had a total of 44 errors/warnings.</li>
    			<li>I'd rate the site's design a 6. While I like the design of the site, and it is overall easy to read, the inconsistency with background colors bothers me. The Guides tab is an entirely different color from the others, which breaks up the flow of the site. Some of the button sections also cut off at the end of the page, with no apparent way to scroll to see the rest of it.</li>
    			<li>I'd rate the usability of the site a 5. While aesthetically pleasing, I find the site somewhat difficult to navigate. There's no dropdowns allowing you to preview what the different sections offer. When you click the sections there's often a <i>long</i> way to scroll on the page, which may make finding content more difficult than a more broken up page would.</li>
    			<li>While difficult to navigate at times, and not the best in design, it does accomplish it's goal in informing others. Of course, I don't think it does the best with this, as the difficulty may cause users to leave without the information.</li>
