		<h1> WEBSITE REVIEW #7 - https://www.hostgator.com/</h1>
		<p>HostGator is a site where you can purchase domains and host your websites.</p>

		<h3>Questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>What is the hosting site name and URL you reviewed?</li>
    			<li>Does the site's home page validate?</li>
    			<li>If you were to have your own website, what would the domain name be?</li> 
    			<li>Using the hosting website, document which of your top 3 preferred domains are available.</li>
    			<li>How would you rate the site's design, on a scale of 1(horrible) to 10 (fantastic)? Why?</li>
    			<li>How would you rate the site's usability on a scale of 1 (horrible) to 10 (fantastic)? Why?</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Answers</h3>
		<ol>
    			<li>The hosting site was HostGator, with https://www.hostgator.com/ being the URL.</li>
    			<li>No, there were errors and warnings on the page when checked with the W3C Markup Validator.</li>
    			<li>If I had my own website, the name would likely be my name, meaning my website would be indirawolski.com. Unless I made a company, I'd likely only use the website as a portfolio, so straightforward is best, I feel.</li>
    			<li>Using Hostgator, the top three domains available that I preferred were indirawolski.com, indirawolskisolutions.com, and indirawolskiportfolio.com. It's nice to know my name isn't taken if/when I choose to make a website of my own to host my portfolio.</li>
    			<li>I rated the design a 6. It's relatively simple and straightforward, but the tendency to wildly change the design of the sight when on new pages throws me off. It makes understanding the sight far more difficult to have everything upended suddenly.</li>
    			<li>For usability I rated the site a 4. Clicking on some sections makes the URL change, so when you click the name it doesn't take you to the home pages, and instead to a login screen? Some of the sections, since they're not broken up, look a bit blocky and harder to differentiate. It is far from ideal as far as websites go, though not entirely unusable.</li>
