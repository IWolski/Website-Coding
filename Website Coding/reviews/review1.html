		<h3>Answers</h3>
		<ol>
    			<li>Yes, it validates.</li>
    			<li>Yes, the second page validated properly.</li> 
    			<li>I received no validation errors or warnings for either page.</li>
    			<li>I would rate the site's design an 9. This is a site I've used before (as I'm not new to HTML & CSS), and the design has always been very functional and nice looking in my opinion. The dropdown menus include links to various things one can learn, and take you to the appropriate pages. However, due to a lot of information there is a lot of links. It's not the nicest when you have to scroll down a list on my computer to see all they offer (though shrinking it may make it difficult to read).</li>
    			<li>I rate the site's usability a 7. Having used the site before, I'm used to it and it's quirks, though there's always been aspect I think could have been better implemented. Such as having a long scroll list on the side when learning a concept. I feel as though adding in some sort of search bar may aid in usability, so a user doens't necessarily have to scroll up and down constantly to find what they're looking for.</li>
    			<li>Absolutely. This site's goal is to teach you code in various ways, and in my experience, it has done so very well. It's been a wonderful resource for me to learn from.</li>
