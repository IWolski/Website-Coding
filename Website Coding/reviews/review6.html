			<h1> WEBSITE REVIEW #6</h1>
			<h3>https://mobiforge.com/design-development/how-to-choose-media-queries-breakpoints-to-best-support-all-connected-devices <br>&<br> https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/how-to-use-css-breakpoints-for-responsive-design/</h3>
			<p>The specific articles linked talk about breakpoints used with media queries. This includes what breakpoints are, some common breakpoints, and how to use them effectively. In general, both websites are tech focused, with the first regarding more articles about technology and web design, while the latter focuses both on articles and different coding aspects (testing, development, etc). </p>

			<h3>Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How does a developer choose which breakpoints to use?</li>
				<li>What are your other findings?</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Answers</h3>
			<ol>
    				<li>Oftentimes, developers appear to choose breakpoints by the most commonly used devices. Many times, this means breaking into widths with points at 320px, 480px, 768px, and 1024px according to the websites. When these specific breakpoints are not used (or like on the first website, not recommended), developers may choose to adjust breakpoints for both bigger sections and then have smaller points that are adjusted as needed to achieve the widest range of user-friendly experience.</li>
    				<li>One point of note that I found interesting, was the fact that the websites appeared to disagree slightly about breakpoints. The second website suggested using common ranges as breakpoints, where as the first website called this way of doing things limited. The first instead recommended making breakpoints according to when they were needed, starting with the larger points, and then the more minor tweaks. Some comments disagreed with the first website's approach as well, making it an interesting point that could be discussed in regards to mobile design. Despite this disagreement, both websites stressed the importance of mobile-first design in today's day and age, due to the large amount of users with smartphones. Overall, the first site offered more in depth looks into the varying appearances websites can take, whereas the second was a bit more technical in talking about what you should/shouldn't use with breakpoints, and how to use it.</li>
