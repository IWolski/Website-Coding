			<h3>Answers</h3>
			<ol>
    				<li>In user testing, users test various aspects of the website. User testing differs from usability testing, for instance, because it encompasses the whole of ther user's experience on the website, rather than just usability testing's more limited scope of testing particular features for functionality. User testing can be done in a variety of ways, from surveys, beta testing, and more. The benefits of this type of testing is that it gives opinions from those who are not necessarily familar with the product, and thus don't have preconcieved ideas of how it should work (and thus are more likely to find issues that those working on the website may not have noticed themselves).</li>
    				<li>When it comes to browsers, they are tested using cross-brower testing. In cross-browser testing, individuals (usually the dev team or quality assurance) tests the website across the various browsers. A large number of things have to be accounted for in-browser testing, from the operation systems, to which aspects to test. Often, browser testing is done via browser emulators. There's any number of things to make decisions on before you ever get to the actual testing phase of browsers.</li>
