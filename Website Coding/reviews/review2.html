		</ol>

		<h3>Answers</h3>
		<ol>
    			<li>Yes, the website validated.</li>
    			<li>Yes, the second site also validated.</li> 
    			<li>No validation errors occured.</li>
    			<li>I'd rate the site's design a 7. Overall, it's nice, but some of the pages look squished together and cluttered. Text is occasionally hard to read as well, particularly the light gray text on white background and white text on gray background.</li>
    			<li>I'd rate the usability of the site a 6. To start with, the homepage is just a bunch of links to articles. The dropdowns are also links to a handful of articles, but you have to click on the navigation options or hover over 'all' to easily see most of the content. There's a search bar, but without the obvious and clear understanding of the site's intent, it's hard to guess what I should be searching for.</li>
    			<li>After clicking through a few pages, it seems like the site is mainly focused on article sharing. It does technically, then, meet it's purpose. I believe it could do much better, however.</li>
