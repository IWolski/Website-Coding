		<h3>Answers</h3>
		<ol>
    			<li>No. Multiple errors and warnings are shown in the W3C Validator for the home page.</li>
    			<li>The second page also had validation errors and warnings.</li> 
    			<li>42 Errors and warnings were shown between the two pages I checked.</li>
    			<li>I'd rate Spotify's website a 9. It's design is simple, straightforward, and aesthetic. It's neither crowded nor confusing in it's layout, and all the text is easy to read. Perhaps the only complain I could think of is possibly making some text larger to accomodate those who have difficulty reading small text, so they wouldn't have to zoom in.</li>
    			<li>Again, I'd rate the website a 9. Spotify is exceptionally easy to navigate and read (though some text could stand to be slightly larger, perhaps), and is all around very easy and convenient to use. Any complaints I found are me trying to nitpick anything I could possibly find that isn't ideal.</li>
    			<li>Yes, Spotify meets it's purpose. It is an extremely popular platform to stream music, a name most people would recognize, and likely use (such as myself). The website is very good at directing individuals to Spotify's features and downloads so that they're able to sign up and start listening to songs, podcats, and the like.</li>
